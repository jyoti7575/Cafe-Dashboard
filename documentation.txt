1. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training

2. Audit:
a. Messy Data:
- Inconsistent casing (coffee, Coffee, COFFEE)
- Wrong data types (Total_Sales as string)
- Missing values in business-critical columns
- Logical errors (negative quantity, price mismatch)
- Date & time chaos
- Redundant columns
- Category leakage (same item under multiple categories)
b. Cleaned Data:
- Initial Data Rows: 10k & Final Data Rows: 7774

3. Business Context:
“This dataset represents daily transactional sales data from a café chain across multiple branches.”
Key business goals:
- Revenue tracking
- Product performance
- Time-based demand
- Category contribution
- Branch-level comparison (if applicable)

4. Python code:
- Loaded necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy and dataset.
- Replaced 'Unknown' & 'Errors' by NaN
- Converting columns into specific data types.
- Removing invalid transactions.
- Fixing & Recalculating Total Spent Column.
- Handling Missing Payment Method & Location by filling 'Unknown'.
- Drop rows having missing date.

5. PowerBI
a. Loaded the cleaned dataset
b. DAX:
- Total Revenue = SUM(cafe_sales[Total Spent])
- Total Transactions = DISTINCTCOUNT(cafe_sales[Transaction ID])
- Total Quantity = SUM(cafe_sales[Quantity])
- AOV = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Transactions])
- Item Url, Payment Method Url, Pickup Url 
c. Charts:
- Line chart – Total Revenue by Month
- Bar Chart - Top 5 Items by Revenue
- Treemap → Revenue by Location
- Stacked Bar → Revenue by Payment Method
- Scatter Plot -> Location-wise Sales & Pricing Analysis

6. Business Driven Insights & Recommendations
a. Quarter 4 Generates the Highest Revenue
Data Evidence: Revenue peaks in Q4 (~17.7K), compared to Q3 (~17.1K).
Insight: There is a clear year-end demand surge, indicating seasonal buying behavior.
Recommendation: Increase staffing, inventory, and promotional activities during Q4 to maximize revenue. Similar offers can be extended into early Q1 to sustain momentum.
b. Food Items Outperform Beverages in Revenue Contribution
Data Evidence:
Salad: 15K
Sandwich: 12K
Smoothie: 12K
Coffee: 6K, Tea: 4K
Insight: Customers generate higher revenue from meal-based items compared to traditional beverages.
Recommendation: Promote meal combos (e.g., Sandwich + Coffee) and prioritize food items in menu promotions, especially during lunch hours.
c. “Unknown” Location Accounts for the Highest Revenue
Data Evidence:
Unknown: 27.63K
In-Store: 21.32K
Takeaway: 20.51K
Insight: A significant portion of revenue is not mapped to a specific location, indicating a data capture or classification gap.
Recommendation: Improve POS data validation to reduce “Unknown” entries and reclassify them into meaningful operational channels for better decision-making.
d. Balanced Use of Payment Methods with High “Unknown” Share
Data Evidence:
Unknown: 22K
Cash: 16K
Digital Wallet: 16K
Credit Card: 16K
Insight: Customers use multiple payment methods evenly, but a large share remains uncategorized.
Recommendation: Enforce mandatory payment method selection at checkout and promote digital payments through loyalty rewards or discounts.
e. Takeaway Orders Show Higher Pricing Efficiency
Data Evidence: Takeaway shows higher average unit price despite lower total quantity compared to In-Store.
Insight: Takeaway customers are less price-sensitive and willing to pay more per unit.
Recommendation: Introduce premium packaging, add-ons, or slightly higher pricing for takeaway orders to increase profit margins without reducing demand.
